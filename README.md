# Claire: The Fuzzy File Finding Light Table plugin with _Style_.
Claire is a fuzzy file finder heavily inspired by Emacs' [ido-mode](http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/InteractivelyDoThings).
It implements a subset of the features ido-mode provides, with a few extra touches.

`claire` is specifically the LightTable plugin for the `claire-files` backend, which is being developed synchronously with
this plugin. The backend can be found in the [claire-files repository](http://github.com/joshuafcole/claire-files).

Claire and its constituent parts are free as in liberty to use as you please to the greatest extent possible. The code is
clean, concise and thoroughly documented with comments. External API should stay consistent, but internal aspects
may change in the future to improve clarity and reusability.
